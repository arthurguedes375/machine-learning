# About:
I made this project as a learning exercise to practice implementing the gradient descent and normal equation.
I haven't found any bugs but I don't guarantee it has none.

# Learning resources that I used:
Besides the libraries' documentations I used the content [free online course](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning) provided by Stanford University and hosted by Coursera as a starting point.
